## About the project
I wanted to work on a project that would take me through the entire workflow of a real-time data analysis life cycle. I have tried my best to include every day-to-day activity of a Data Analyst.

Ever since the pandemic has started, the market rates have kept changing dynamically, thus, making the process of data visualization and interpretation much harder. A one stop platform of accurate, easy to understand insights on the subject and activities is what I am willing to work on. This will not only help the users get a clear big picture and answer to what they are looking for, but will also help make the planning and decision making process easier and faster.

## Problem Statement
Consider a trusted hardware company based in India, that supplies its products through out the country.
The company has divided itself into 3 market regions, North, Central and South. Each region has ts own regional manager.

Up until now, all the communication, discussions and confirmations between the managing directors and the regional heads have been taking place verbally, which
for obvious reasons is not the most reliable way, especially to discuss numbers and insights.
The data entry being done currently is also being done in the most primitave ways, by using various MS Excel files and spreadsheets. This is not only puzzling for the users to go through it for the first time but is also 
very time consuming. Not to mention, the amount of manual  work, which is a very important factor as more the manual work,
more the money spent.

Currently, the company works on a sales management system that is handles bt the IT depertment. This software stores the required data and all 
the other significant occourancesand records in a data base.
This data base is accisible to the data engineers and data analysists of the company.

Thus, the **end product required** is a powerful dashboard that will help you track the revenue numbers and sales quantity numbers periodically. One must also be able to track down the revenue breakdown regionally 
or product-wise. Anther main objective that I am hoping to fullfill is to be open to suggestions, reedbacks and critisizms. Just like how it works in the real world, these reporst and dahsboards created by data analystsare reviewd and 
tested by the various stakeholders such as the managing director, regional heads, inverstors, marketing leads etc.
This will not only help me improve my work but will also as to what various authorities look for in such projects. 

# Objective
- Easily accesible, interactive, self explainatory sales insights dashboards.
- Less arduous and time consuming.
- Direct access to every required detail without having to coordinate with other people.
- Take data driven decsions easily.

## The approach
The first step would be to set up a meeting with the stakeholders, the IT Head and the Data Department and brainstorm on the project. Here, we choose to let the **Aims Grid** gude us.

**AIMS GRID** is a project management strategy that is divided into 4 parts:

- **Aim/ Objective/ Purpose** : To unlock sales insights that were not visible before for the sales team , to reduse manual time spent in data gathering and interpretation.
- **Stakeholders/ Clients** : 
- **End Result**
- **Success Criteria**

One of the main purposes od the AIMS grid is to see the interdependence of the different factors
mentioned above. This helps clarify any kind of task because all the work is now systematically broken down. It also helps present a project in a 
consise manner. Though, there is always a chance that the initially set success criteria and other factors might have to change depending on the stakeholdrs, clients, and various other consstrains. This might lead to a significant change
in the end result. This is what makes creating a fully fexible, adaptive and interactive insight even more necessary.
